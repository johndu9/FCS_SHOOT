COMETLAND:
  A weak and evil empire, COMETLAND is one of
  the foolish few who dare challenge the power
  of SPACECRAFTIA. Their marauding fleet, armed
  with hulls of a rare metal found only in
  COMETLAND's planets, has been harassing the
  SPACECRAFTIAN borders for far too long. As a
  result, SPACECRAFTIA has sent its elite FCS
  FLEET to invade COMETLAND directly.
