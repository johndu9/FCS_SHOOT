TO PLAY, RUN FCS_SHOOT.bat!

Thanks for downloading FCS_SHOOT and reading the README! Then again, this place is pretty empty, so I don't blame you for not reading this.

Don't forget to read LICENSE.txt. It tells you, the consumer, what you can do with this game.

You can change some settings in the settings.txt. Controls in controls.txt. There's also "skins" in the skn folder, if you want to check those out, too.

This game is 100% free, but you can always donate if you're really satisfied or charitable. If you're serious about donating, contact me via email. We'll sort something out.
